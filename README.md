# Folder Viewer

- Browse within the selected root folder using breadcrumbs and back navigation
- Save favorite folders and jump back to them from the toolbar
- View file creation time, modification time, and size
- Calculate the size of individual folders or all folders in the current directory
- Open files with their registered VS Code editor
- Cut, copy, paste, rename, and delete files and folders
- Copy one or more absolute paths
- Open a folder in the integrated terminal
- Compress files and folders into ZIP archives
- Extract ZIP archives with progress and cancellation support
- Use multi-selection and familiar keyboard shortcuts
